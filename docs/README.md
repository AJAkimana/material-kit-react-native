# Material Kit React Native

Material Kit React Native is a beautiful resource built over Galio, React Native and Expo to allow you to create powerful and beautiful e-commerce mobile applications. We have redesigned all the usual components in Galio to make it look flat, minimalist and easy to use.

Using the mobile application is very simple, but it does require you to understand basic JavaScript functions and React Native. To get the desired effect you will need to integrate React components and JS plugins that take a little bit more effort. Down below we list all the files you need to include inside the application to get going.
