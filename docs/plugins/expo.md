# Expo
[https://expo.io](https://expo.io)

Expo apps are the same thing as React Native apps but they're using the Expo SDK. This SDK enables developers to easily access a lot of native features like the camera, local storage, and other features. Expo also provides a lot of other UI components like icons or blur views in order to enhance the user experience. 

Do you need Push notifications? Well Expo can manage that for you as well. 

So using Expo was an easy choice. Their API is easy to use and rich in features. You can always eject the app and use only react-native but you'll lose the opporunity to play with the Expo SDK.
